My name is Mark and I am a cybersecurity professional. 

I have been around computers and technology all my life, but began this profession almost 6 years ago.

I decided to create this blog to share and showcase my projects and interests.

Besides anything related to cybersecurity I am also passionate about movies, photography, vinyl record collecting, and being outdoors.
